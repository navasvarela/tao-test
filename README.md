# Extrinsics exercise

Using inspiration from this article: https://coldint.io/hello-world/, create a script that checks the pending extrinsics for add_stake or add_stake_limit on subnet 4. 
Then if an extrinsic is found, create your own add_stake extrinsic that would buy 1 tao worth of subnet 4 token and have it be submitted on the same block that you found the pending extrinsic on.
